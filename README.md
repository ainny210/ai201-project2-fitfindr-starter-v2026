     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->

FitFindr helps a user search for secondhand clothing based on a description, size, and maximum price. It selects a matching item and suggests an outfit using pieces from the user's existing wardrobe. It then creates a short fit-card caption for the completed outfit. If no listing matches, the agent stops and tells the user what they can change in their search.

---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`



- **What it does:** Searches the available clothing listings using the user's description, size, and maximum price.
- **Inputs:** `description` (string), `size` (string), `max_price` (float)
- **Returns:** A list of matching listing dictionaries containing the listing details.
- **When it has nothing:** Returns an empty list if no listings match the search.

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Suggests an outfit by pairing the selected new item with items from the user's wardrobe.
- **Inputs:** `new_item` (dictionary), `wardrobe` (dictionary)
- **Returns:** A string containing the generated outfit suggestion.
- **When it has nothing:** Handles an empty wardrobe without crashing and returns styling ideas using the new item alone.

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Creates a fit-card caption for the completed outfit.
- **Inputs:** `outfit` (string), `new_item` (dictionary)
- **Returns:** A string containing the generated fit-card caption.
- **When it has nothing:** Returns a clear message if no outfit suggestion is provided.

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:** If `search_listings` returns an empty list, store a helpful message in the session and stop. Otherwise, select the first matching listing and continue to `suggest_outfit`, then `create_fit_card`.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** The query is parsed using regex and string matching to extract the description, size, and maximum price.

**What moves through the session:** The parsed query goes into `search_results`, the chosen result becomes `selected_item`, that item goes into `outfit_suggestion`, and the final result goes into `fit_card`.

---

## Sample Run

**One full query**

```text
$ python agent.py

=== A query the data can match ===
found: Y2K Baby Tee - Butterfly Print — $18.0 on Depop
outfit: The agent suggested outfits using the selected Y2K Baby Tee and pieces from the user's wardrobe, including baggy straight-leg jeans, chunky white sneakers, and a black crossbody bag.
fit card: Fluttering straight out of the year 2000 into my everyday rotation. I styled this butterfly baby tee with baggy dark denim and chunky sneakers for an effortless Y2K street-style vibe. Snagged this beauty on Depop for just $18.00!

=== A query it can't ===
stopped: No matching listings found. Try changing the description, size, or maximum price.
fit_card is None — it should still be None here
```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```text
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print(search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30))"

Returned matching listing dictionaries for graphic tees priced at $30 or less.
```

```text
$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe, load_listings; print(suggest_outfit(load_listings()[0], get_example_wardrobe()))"

Returned outfit suggestions using the new item with specific pieces from the user's wardrobe.
```

```text
$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; from utils.data_loader import load_listings; print(create_fit_card('jeans and white sneakers', load_listings()[0]))"

Returned a generated fit-card caption that included the selected item, price, platform, and outfit vibe.
```

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- **What I asked for:** I asked AI to help me understand how to implement and test the three FitFindr tools in `tools.py`.
- **What came back:** AI explained how the search filters, wardrobe handling, and fit-card generation could work and helped me debug the code.
- **What I changed:** I tested each tool myself in the terminal and adjusted the implementation so `search_listings` returns an empty list when nothing matches and `suggest_outfit` still works with an empty wardrobe.

**Moment 2**

- **What I asked for:** I asked AI to help me understand the planning-loop requirements and troubleshoot my `agent.py` implementation.
- **What came back:** AI helped me identify the query-parsing and regex issues and explained how the no-results branch should stop the loop.
- **What I changed:** I used a simpler regex for extracting the maximum price and tested both the matching and no-match paths with `python agent.py`.

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
